# react-spline

**react-spline** allows you to export and use Spline scenes directly in your React websites.

ðŸŒˆ [Spline](https://spline.design/) is a friendly 3d collaborative design tool for the web.

## Install

```bash
yarn add @splinetool/react-spline @splinetool/runtime
```

or

```bash
npm install @splinetool/react-spline @splinetool/runtime
```

## Usage

To use react-spline, first you have to go to the Spline editor, click on the **Export** button, select "**Code**" and then "**React**".

You should see this:

<img width="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splinetool/react-spline/main/.github/screenshots/react-export-pane.png">

You can copy the URL and pass it to the `<Spline />` component in react:

```jsx
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Spline scene="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

You should be able to see the scene you exported in your React app.

**NOTE**: If you are experiencing CORS issues, you can download the .splinecode file and self-host it; this will fix any CORS issue. To download, go to Spline's code export panel and click on the download icon visible in the prod.spline textarea.

### Next.js

You can use this library in Next.js as well to take advantage of Server Side Rendering. By default the library will render on the client only, but if you use the import `@splinetool/react/next` the server will render an autogenerated blurred placeholder.

Here is an example. Export as `Next.js` from the Spline editor to autogenerate the placeholder.

```js
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline/next';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Spline scene="https://prod.spline.design/KFonZGtsoUXP-qx7/scene.splinecode" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Read and modify Spline objects

You can query any Spline object via `findObjectByName` or `findObjectById`.

_(You can get the ID of the object by right-clicking on it and selecting `Copy Development Object ID`)._

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline';

export default function App() {
  const cube = useRef();

  function onLoad(spline) {
    const obj = spline.findObjectByName('Cube');
    // or
    // const obj = spline.findObjectById('8E8C2DDD-18B6-4C54-861D-7ED2519DE20E');

    // save it in a ref for later use
    cube.current = obj;
  }

  function moveObj() {
    console.log(cube.current); // Spline Object => { name: 'Cube', id: '8E8C2DDD-18B6-4C54-861D-7ED2519DE20E', position: {}, ... }

    // move the object in 3D space
    cube.current.position.x += 10;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Spline
        scene="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
        onLoad={onLoad}
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={moveObj}>
        Move Cube
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Listen to Spline Events

You can listen to any Spline Event you set in the Events panel of the editor by attaching a listener to the Spline component.

```jsx
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline';

export default function App() {
  function onSplineMouseDown(e) {
    if (e.target.name === 'Cube') {
      console.log('I have been clicked!');
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Spline
        scene="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
        onSplineMouseDown={onSplineMouseDown}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Event listeners in the [Spline Component Props](#spline-component-props) section.

### Trigger Spline events from outside

You can trigger any animation Event you set in the Events panel in the Spline Editor.

You can use the `emitEvent` function via the spline ref, passing the [event type](#spline-events) and the ID of your object.

_(You can get the ID of the object in the `Develop` pane of the right sidebar)._

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline';

export default function App() {
  const spline = useRef();

  function onLoad(splineApp) {
    // save the app in a ref for later use
    spline.current = splineApp;
  }

  function triggerAnimation() {
    spline.current.emitEvent('mouseHover', 'Cube');
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Spline
        scene="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
        onLoad={onLoad}
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={triggerAnimation}>
        Trigger Spline Animation
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Or you can query the spline object first, and then trigger the event:

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import Spline from '@splinetool/react-spline';

export default function App() {
  const objectToAnimate = useRef();

  function onLoad(spline) {
    const obj = spline.findObjectByName('Cube');
    // save the object in a ref for later use
    objectToAnimate.current = obj;
  }

  function triggerAnimation() {
    objectToAnimate.current.emitEvent('mouseHover');
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Spline
        scene="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode"
        onLoad={onLoad}
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={triggerAnimation}>
        Trigger Spline Animation
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Events you can pass to the `emitEvent` function in the [Spline Events](#spline-events) section.

### Lazy loading

To start loading react-spline after the whole website has finished loading, we can use lazy-loading. This technique can be achieved using [`React.lazy()`](https://it.reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) in combination with dynamic imports:

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const Spline = React.lazy(() => import('@splinetool/react-spline'));

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Spline scene="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode" />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

More info in the [relative React documentation](https://it.reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).

### Spline App Methods

The object exposed as a first argument of the `onLoad` function, is a Spline Application. You can call all these different methods on it.

| Name               | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `emitEvent`        | `(eventName: SplineEventName, nameOrUuid: string) => void` | Triggers a Spline event associated to an object with provided name or uuid.                                                 |
| `emitEventReverse` | `(eventName: SplineEventName, nameOrUuid: string) => void` | Triggers a Spline event associated to an object with provided uuid in reverse order. Starts from last state to first state. |
| `findObjectById`   | `(uuid: string) => SPEObject`                              | Searches through scene's children and returns the object with that uuid.                                                    |
| `findObjectByName` | `(name: string) => SPEObject`                              | Searches through scene's children and returns the first object with that name.                                              |
| `setZoom`          | `(zoom: number) => void`                                   | Sets the initial zoom of the scene.                                                                                         |

### Spline Events

These are all the Spline event types that you can pass to the `emitEvent` or `emitEventReverse` function.

| Name         | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `mouseDown`  | Refers to the Spline `Mouse Down` event type  |
| `mouseHover` | Refers to the Spline `Mouse Hover` event type |
| `mouseUp`    | Refers to the Spline `Mouse Up` event type    |
| `keyDown`    | Refers to the Spline `Key Down` event type    |
| `keyUp`      | Refers to the Spline `Key Up` event type      |
| `start`      | Refers to the Spline `Start` event type       |
| `lookAt`     | Refers to the Spline `Look At` event type     |
| `follow`     | Refers to the Spline `Mouse Up` event type    |
